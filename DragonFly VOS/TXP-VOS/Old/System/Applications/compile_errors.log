Most of these are warnings, related to the logging system. These will be fixed soon, when I break up the file writing process into two file-appending lines instead of one.
The errors that actually matter (and are few in number - 5 in total) all relate to data types (conversion errors) and a logging filename that probably just needs to be changed, because I'm using Linux resources.

The kernel.cpp file should be virtually error free. The Bootloader and kernel (written in Assembler), on the other hand, may need some work...

This is the last major update for the userspace systems.
