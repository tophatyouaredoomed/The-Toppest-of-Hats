  If  you're  using  libc5,  don't worry, I used to use libc5! If
you're  brave,  edit  'dns.c'  and  uncomment  line  45, pray and
compile.  If  it  doesn't  work, email me (most probably a header
include problem); if you succeed, report it to me anyway!

  Dillo  compiles  on BSD systems; I was reported success on some
of  them.  FreeBSD  may  need -pthread instead of -lpthread. Ah!,
it  seems  that  NetBSD  doesn't  implement threads as LWP (Light
weigth  processes), so you may need to undefine G_DNS_THREADED or
set a single server in dns.c.

  gcc 2.95.2 has problems with -O2:
     "-O2 -mcpu=pentium" works fine.
     "-O0 -mcpu=k6 -march=pentium -g3" works fine also.
     "-O -mcpu=k6 -march=pentium -g3" works fine as well, but
     "-O2 -mcpu=k6 -march=pentium -g3" doesn't work. Then again
     "-O6 -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -g3" DOES work.


  Dillo  can be invoked either as "dillo" or as "dillo <url>". If
you  get  an  error that dillo can't load the shared library, try
"setenv  LD_LIBRARY_PATH  /usr/local/lib",  or  wherever you have
your gtk+ libs.

  You  may  experience  some  font handling problems derived from
locale  handling (for instance if you use LC_ALL=sv_SE). Just try
LC_ALL=POSIX and it will be fine.

  This is still alpha code, but it works.

  Here's a list of some well known problems:

      * no FRAMES rendering
      * no cookies
      * no FTP
      * no https
